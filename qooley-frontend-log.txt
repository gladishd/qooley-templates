    Updates:
    * Provided that we're already displaying the town name if the user went through the sequence of filtering first then pressing the Venue card which displays the Admission Price underneath, on localhost:3000/venue?venueId=The-Kinetic-Playground maintaining the street address and so displaying the city on the venue page because we're on a new page; we want to prevent redundancies. Instead of the Price, it's going to be the Address in that the Venues card should display the street address below the card. After successfully portraying the address on the venue card, standardizes the admission price field by adding a $ sign before the field. The Admission Price field has been standardized, meaning when new venues are created the admission price carries no more than one dollar sign. For testing purposes, makes sure fake venues aren't showing up on prod by deleting fake venues before pushing to prod to seem realistic! For pages/venue.js, the tutorial is concentrated on using the useEffect hook which, according to https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html, is most similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.
    
    * As a result, includes the tutorial https://medium.com/@allynak/how-to-use-google-map-api-in-react-app-edb59f64ac9d command navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success) from componentDidMount. Goes in this order: this.success calls this.setCurrentPosition. We get a different error if we do markers without the map. Google Maps Integration - when they click on the card, adds Google Maps integration so they can look at the venue on the map. The price range is a drop-down on the venues. If they want to see where the venue is at, they can click on it. They can also click on the information card on the map. Removes HTTPS frontend-backend compatibility explanation for the backend API route on next.config.js on the front-end. Recall that where someone fills out a new venue through the /venues page, the qooley-webapp signup should make a card on the website; test out with a fake venue.
    
    * developers.google.com/maps/get-started#api-key
    * How to Use Google Map API in a React App. Begin with medium.com/@allynak.
    (1) Create a Google Map account and generate the API Key
    (2) Install the NPM package
    (3) Rendering. Proper Import Libraries: react, @react-google-maps/api
        * GoogleMap
        * LoadScript
        * Marker
        * InfoWindow
    
    (4) Create the MapContainer component with attributes
         * mapStyles
         * defaultCenter, rendering the first GoogleMap component.
    
    * Removes unused imports
    
    * The defaultCenter being located in Barcelona, you will not be able to view the map without defining a size. You can also define default lat and lng where the map should center upon first render.
    
    * Import the Marker component from '@react-google-maps/api' and instead of closing the Google Map component
     {
       locations.map(item => {
         return (
           <Marker key={item.name}
           position={item.location}
         )
       })
     } </GoogleMap>
    
    * What else are the parameters for the LoadScript, GoogleMap, Marker components? They are found on https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/.
    
    * The location object must actually have lat and lng as keys. The tutorial pivots to no array of locations and anything related to the markers and infoWindows. Focus on rendering the map with a maker on the current location of the user, using the Geolocation API. The Navigator.geolocation read-only property developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/geolocation returns a Geolocation object. Dragging the marker sets the current location locally.
    
    * "Instead of the Price, it's going to be the Address." "The Venues card should display the street address below the card."
    
    * localhost:3000 is where the address should be displayed, on this.state.carouselDisplay['Venues']
    
    * Instead of { venueData && venueData.priceRange } want { venueData && venueData.locationAddress } which does not include the venueData.city attribute. This necessitates modifying the .reactMultiCarouselCardStars class which raises the question, are the styles getting applied on hover?
    
    * Modifies the CSS to such an extent that the .reactMultiCarouselCardStars class attributes are maintainted in a different form such that the text doesn't take up more than 100% width.
    
    * To match the font size of Immersive Experiences duration, the font size is now 1.285vh. What else you can inspect element from .immersiveExperienceDuration is white-space: nowrap; padding-bottom: 0.75em; text-align: left; align-self: flex-end;.
    
    * Instead of messing with the priceOptions[i].label.split(' ').slice(1).join() it is better to fix the problem at its source: modify the priceOptions object itself, for venues. Specifically, instead of modifying pages/venue.js the display page, want to modify localhost:3000/venues Admission Price (4) which is from this.state.allPriceRanges from the this.state = {... initial declared value. Changes the label property which means that whenever a new venue is created, the price renders with one dollar sign per integer.
    
    * Makes new venues Adler Planetarium and Shedd Aquarium while recycling the old.
    
    * On localhost:3000/venues, should we not change the URL slug from /venues to /signup-venues or something similar? Because right now, anyone with the link can create a new venue.
    
    * Should we impose a Phone Number format such as the Shedd Aquarium phone number (312) 939-2438 on the localhost:3000/venues page?
    
    * The External Links (Optional) field does not seem to be capturing the key press "," or Enter. Yes the regExp function works, but why would we ever need to truncate (ignoring underscores and hyphens) all our tags; that is where are we using the TagsSubmission component? It appears that one cannot create Immersive Experiences unless one is logged in. The TagsSubmission component governs the submission of YOUR external links.
    
    * On the Edit Profile page which likewise doesn't allow the submission of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedd_Aquarium and therefore the fault lies within the TagsSubmission component because !this.validUrl(trimmedInput) because prior to validUrl, the trimmedInput goes through this.regExp(this.state.input).trim();. TagsSubmission is imported and used within External Links Edit Profile and Venues External Links (Optional).
    
    * Updates the swal constructor
     swal({
       title:
       text:
       icon:
       duration:
     }), for when the URL isn't valid.
    
    * The External Links (Optional) maintains the same blue background color as the other boxes: background-color: rgb(232, 240, 254).
    
    * Since /qooleybiz?true is white and /venues is rgb(232, 240, 254), it might be worth it to pass down boolean as props to the component TagsSubmission. The resulting ternay on pages/tagsSubmission.js is based on this.props.blue.
    
    * Having new swal({... for invalid URLs; the class constructor requires the new keyword.
    
    * On the How To Use Google Map API in React App article by @allynak, now when the user clicks on the marker, an infoWindow opens with the name of the object and an x button to close the component.
    
    * It's important to get everything, from the mapStyles object to the defaultCenter object, rendering.
    
    * What kind of Map does one get if the System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Location Services checklist is enabled for Chrome? If it is not enabled for Chrome?
    
    * Why can't we continue short circuit evaluation like { console.log(this.state.currentPosition) && this.state.currentPosition.lat && (<Marker position={this.state.currentPosition} />) } in JSX?
    
    * The onDragEnd function variable is innate to the Marker component.
    
    * We need to do the conversion from venue address to venue latitude and longitude. All we need to do is turn the locations object
    const locations = [
      {
        name: "Location 1",
        location: {
          lat: 41.3954,
          lng: 2.162
        },
      }, ...
    ]
    into a name, location, and possibly a description.
    
    * How to populate the <InfoWindow component on React Google Map API that is Geocoding rapidapi.com/blog/google-maps-api-react/ or npmjs.com/package/react-geocode.
    
    * Currently, the marker is not editable. Translates venue address into the latitude longitude marker: yes, the API key is optional if you want to use the Google Maps Geocoding API.
    
    * developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding => use the Maps JavaScript API key after enabling the Geocoding API.
    
    * What does it mean to enable the Geocoding API? It means to, on console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list?project=qooleybiz, select a maps-related Additional APIs member and really like the shadow and spotlight on Credentials: top-right Learn tab: Restrict your API key tutorial because it reveals that the API key, the manually-created Server Key appellation, exists on Credentials.
    
    * After enabling Maps API key access for Geocoding, currently displaying the Map hinges on navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(this.success).
    
    * Feeds the Venue address into Geocode like Geocode.fromAddress(this.state.venueData.locationAddress + ", " + this.state.venueData.city).
    
    * The "let" keyword lets us modify objects declared outside the scope of the React component.
    
    * onSelect really becomes displayInfoWindow.
    
    * Removes vast swathes of commented-out code and console logs.
    
    Todo:
    * From within @react-google-maps/api, it's important to add clickable InfoWindows; that means
     {
       this.state.selected.location &&
       <InfoWindow
       position={this.state.selected.location}
       clickable={true}
       onCloseClick={ () =>
        this.setState({
          selected: {}
        })}
     }> <p>{this.state.selected.name}</p>
     </InfoWindow>
    
    * Standardize the Admission Price field by adding a $ sign before the field. The reason for this is that the numerous $ signs are for the sake of display because the expert cards are rendering price underneath, whereas the venue cards are instead rendering address.
    
    * Test the TagsSubmission component.
         * Venue submission should redirect you to that venue's page.
         * Social Media Links on /venue need to be truncated to fit the width of the profile page.
    
    * Test deletion of externalLinks. ExternalLinks should allow submission of Wikipedia image links; what is validUrl doing?
    
    * Read the GoogleMap component documentation.
    
    * Want zoom to show up to the distance between you and the venue.

    The TagsInput component should not be imported from react-tagsinput

Date:   Mon Mar 21 23:57:09 2022 -0500

    This commit is to address the 500 | Internal Server Error, to fix the missing Error: Cannot find module 'react-tagsinput'. Aside from API keys being relevant to the POST, USE, PUT, DELETE, and GET routes on the backend, and aside from the assignment of function calls like SweetAlert2.fire({}) having the exception of pages/venues.js, where SweetAlert2.fire({}) takes the form of a constructor.
    
    Todo: add timestamp like ei to the URL.
    
    Based on pluralsight.com/guides/hiding-secret-keys-in-create-react-app, the initiative is to create a .env file at the root.
    // .env
    FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
    FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
    
    Add .env to .gitignore
    // .gitignore
    .env
    
    Make an API call with a Secret key in your <App /> component
    
    const API_KEY=process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY
    
    In public/index.html
    <title>%FIREBASE_API_KEY%</title>
    
    https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
    
    The font difference between class names mainpageExpertSignup and mainpageSubHeaderSignup is that the latter has a -webkit-text-stroke: 1 px block; which has been commented out.
    
    qooley.com/login, Continue takes the browser to https://www.qooley.com/local?userId=, Edit Profile page. The (X) GET https://www.qooley.com/qooleybiz?true leads to 500 | Internal Server Error because the /qooleybiz?true reaches 500 internal server error because on the qooley-frontend app (see the Papertrail add-on), the Error: Cannot find module 'react-tagsinput' is a part of the Edit Profile page. With heroku run bash, run npm commands. With heroku logs -t --app qooley-frontned, see console logs like Error: Cannot find module 'react-tagsinput' and GET requests. With the Papertrail add-on of Heroku, server logs exist, the same on dashboard.heroku.com/apps/qooley-frontend. A CORS-related error can be achieved even with permission from qooley-webapp middleware; so long as frontend expects imports and the imports are not provided.
    
    The case-sensitive paths webpack plugin is part of webpack configuration. Building a tag input field component solves the 500 | Internal Server Error. blog.logrocket.com/building-a-tag-input-field-component-for-react, for which input is the local input, tags are the collection of tags and isKeyReleased determines what the TagsSubmission component does. For ESLint, Webpack and NPM, there seem to be some challenges associated with the updating, and the configuration such as eslint.workingDirectories (lifesaver.codes/answer/failed-to-load-plugin-react-declared-in-react). The first step is to render tags passed to the component, expanding upon just <input /> with three different key types ",", "Backspace", and onKeyUp. While focusing on the text box, isKeyReleased toggles from key press to key release. The TagsSubmission component has keys input, isKeyReleased, tags, and trimmedInput. The types of input events are:
    
    * onChange(event). This event is required only for listening to the changes on the input field and updating the input state variable. event.target.value accumulates <input text because value = {this.state.input} />. The container related classes in -grid.scss have padding-right, padding-left: 15px; which are ported to the in-line style={{}} div.
    
    * onKeyDown(event). Destructures the key property of event. Since input is accumulated on this.state.input by onChange, onKeyDown is for keys "," and "Backspace", and concatenates trimmed input (because tags should not have whitespace) from this.state.input to this.state.tags and vice versa.
    
    * onKeyUp sets the value of isKeyReleased to true, since onKeyDown sets the value of isKeyReleased to false.
    
    In the fashion of react-tagsinput, sets styles like padding to 15px, border color width and radius to be determined, and border style to 'solid', without margin auto for the sake of display flex with flex-wrap quackit.com/css/flexbox/examples/flexbox_grid_examples.cfm. There are gaps of 5px, and justifyContent: center padding-left has been moved to 7.5px.
    
    The deleteTag function filters the existing tags on this.state based on index which is inherent in the { () => deleteTag(index) } onClick method of <button ... />. This requires the multiplication symbol x to be drawn, (meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/) which allows the existing button to more easily be clicked on.
    
    The Qooley colors are light blue and purple, which means #519de3 and #5f0455, and which matches the rest of the buttons and tittles #5f0455. Aside from functionality, rgb 81, 157, 227 is navy blue and rgb 88 81 156 is the blend between navy blue and rgb 95 4 85, Qooley purple which constitutes the text color. In the <TagsInput /> component from react-tagsinput, class styles being the react-tagsinput class, the value = {this.state.tags} onChange = {this.onChange}. This might be clear for github1s users.
    
    The TagsSubmission component is originally imported, from pages/tagsSubmission.js for which are provided propFunction; replaces the base component TagsInput import from 'react-tagsinput' and only modifies the TagsInput component within the tagsSubmission.js file by replacing it.
    
    Thanks to the creators, at npmjs.com/package/react-tagsinput has the data type for tags of String[]. It is worth it to retain regexp tag validation, which can be done within onChange to make available advanced validation. In onChangeInput, tag .replace(/([^\w-\s]+)|(^\s+)/g,""), docs.trifecta.com/display/DP/Supported+Special+Regular+Expression+Characters the forward slash character is used to denote the boundaries of the regular expression. www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html. Parentheses are for group sub-expressions for overriding the precedence. [^\w-\s means any characters which do not match between a word and a whitespace and this includes integers but not characters like *|&@(#$. (jsfiddle.net). .replace(/\s+/g, "-") means globally match one or more whitespaces and replace with one or more hyphens. This means that all our tags are truncated to ordinary words separated by hyphens.
    
    The pages/tagsSubmission is as follows: the users collection has all new externalLinks property on each user email document. However, on localhost:3000/qooleybiz?true, this.state.tags out of all { tags: Array(8), isKeyReleased: false, input: '', trimmedInput: '' } for which input is transferred into the next comma-separated element on trimmedInput locally, while tags is derived from the database. In order to parse trimmedInput, first filter the tags by regular expressions and then put a list of tags on this.state which is rendered in blue undeneath the purple tags. For most events, except perhaps the event.key=="Meta" event, we can handle and parse. Apply regular expressions to this.state.input, instead of apply regexp to this.state.tags.map((tag) => . That is instead of this.state.trimmedInput being continually derived from this.state.tags, it should be derived from the momentary variable this.state.input. These tags are rendered in a different color like the existing this.state.
    
    These tags are supposed to be External Links, so they need formatting like Social Media links.
    
    Functions, all reused code need to be moved to their own separate files. Only the last external link will be valid on the database because propFunction exists, and in this is the assumption that this.state.externalLinks is an array of comma-separated tags. This is all a part of the propFunction which is invoked, during the onChange function in tagsSubmission.js. If the submit scope were in the tagsSubmission.js, wishfully then the submit scope should be used. onKeyDown is the scope of tag submission, if key ===',' and this.state.input still exists after trimming, and neither the preexisting tags nor the new tags exist, ... this is the place to call this.props.propFunction (event.target.value isn't cumulative!) on [...this.state.tags, ...this.state.newTags]. No need to distinguish between trimmedInput and input on this.state when trimmedInput is an intermediary stage between this.state.input and this.state.newTags.
    
    Look at sweetalert2.github.io/#examples for sweetalert previews. If the trimmed input is not valid by RegExp standards, then, since the !this.validUrl and the propFunction are in if/else statements, the validity of the URL is a prerequisite for POSTing both to the frontend and to the qooleybiz.users.email externalLinks object on the user's document, then it should not get posed locally. The TagsInput component has been discontinued.
    
    To solve (!) Reference Error: index is not defined occurs when clicking the delete button styled x. {() => this.deleteTag(index)} doesn't need to change because the index is from somewhere else:
    
    The {tags.map((tag, index) => (<div className="tag">{tag}<button onClick={()=>deleteTag(index)...} index has been added back. Then, the delete button appears to be working locally whereas on the database there is no change, therefore the parameter data structure need to be considered. Clicking on the Delete Tag x causes redirect to localhost:3000/local?userId= which hinges on, upon login in componentDidMount, this.props.query !== '' or upon click x in the global scope of the submitEdits function, when accessing localhost:3000/qooleybiz?true, this.props.query = { true: "" }.
    
    On qooleybiz/index.js, when we are logged out it gives GET 400 (Bad Request) infinite redirect loop error message: Error: Request failed with status code 400. This error is thrown during the first try/catch block of componentDidMount; user database queries in succession. GET http://localhost:4000/logout 400 (Bad Request), Uncaught (in promise) Error: Request failed with status code 400, Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component, TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'email'). The redirect on click reaches submitEdits because <Form onSubmit={this.submitEdits} as the console responds to the guess. This could be a good use case for event.prev. This doesn't have to happen in-line. e.preventDefault can happen within the function submitEdits itself, e.preventDefault being for preventing the default HTML derived event.
    
    The value this.state.externalLinks does not reflect the deletion, data["externalLinks"]=this.state.externalLinks, meaning deleted tags are still being returned from tagsSubmission.js. What propFunction is doing is variably setting the parent component's this.state.externalLinks while only being invoked on press ",". propFunction should be returning the value of non-deleted tags. The deleteTag function is filtering out undesirable tags. propFunction is only invoked for each key press "," and really should be invoked to update the parent state whenever there is a change in the local state so posibly invoke the propFunction within the deleteTag function.
    
    Testing External Links on Edit Profile and on Signup yields (!) Unhandled Runtime Error ReferenceError: tags is not defined, Line 103, if (key==='BackSpace' && !this.state.tags.length && tags.length) should be tags && tags.length so that pressing Backspace when there are no tags does not run this block of code. One can delete external links. They don't show up on the database unless this.props.propFunction[...this.state.tags, ...this.state.newTags, this.state.input] is called upon. Frontend changes on /qooleybiz?true aren't actually submitted to the database unless the user clicks Save. This particular most recently deleted tag (and not the previously deleted tags) error of still remaining on the database can be resolved by, instead of using the delayed value of this.state.tags even after setting this.state. Solve this issue by spelling out as a variable which is available faster than this.state.tags, for which
    
    -----let tags = this.state.tags.filter((tag,i) => i !== index)
    -----this.props.propFunction([...tags, ...this.state.newTags, this.state.input]).
    
    (!) It appears that a blank tag is submitted to the database when if (key === 'Backspace' && !this.state.input.length && this.state.tags.length) then Backspace deletes tags, not text.
    
    (!) deleting a tag causes the blank link "" to show up on the database. This blank link doesn't get sent to this.props.propFunction from pages/tagsSubmission.js but it does get put on this.state.externalLinks in pages/local?userId= which means (back before pages/qooleybiz/index.js sends us to /local?userId=' + this.state.profileData.username), that the data object on submitEdits is reflecting the blank link from this.state.externalLinks on submitEdits, pages/qooleybiz/index.js, the propFunction is not the culprit; this.state.input, being set to '' means that what we pass to propFunctio nin deleteTag shouldn't include this.state.input because instead of Enter key inserting this.state.input, delete click does not regard what the user has just entered and instead regards only the existing tags, original and new and staged tags, staged on this.state.input are not to be submitted unless the Enter key has been pressed for that value of this.state.input.
    
    propFunction is on, within deleteTag, [...tags, ...this.state.newTags] and excludes this.state.input. Now that this issue has been solved, (!) Pressing Backspace doesn't finalize the deletion and (!) Press all of the delete buttons and all of the corresponding external links will remain undeleted. Array.prototype.pop() removes the last elements from the array, and changes the length of the array. The solution is to, on "Backspace", invoke this.props.propFunction. ([...tagsCopy, ...this.state.newTags]). The tags are being set to [] on pages/qooleybiz/index.js. In pages/qooleybiz/index.js, unlike data["externalLinks"], bio and whybook are required whereas externalLinks cannot be assumed to be with length greater than 0, which means: *removes the this.state.externalLinks.length > 0 requirement.
    
    On qooley.com/signup qooley.com/qooleybiz, External Links (optional) has more permissive URL checking, the divs are centered with variable row length accommodating the box width standardized. Furthermore, qooley.com/local?userId= is designed to center the external links when *they need some styling. These external links have been left-justified. This commit is designed to fix the Error: Cannot find module 'react-tagsinput' present on my.papertrailapp.com/systems/qooley-frontend/events.

    Places API keys in process.env: in ./public/index.html, removes the comments and script src for the Places Autocomplete widget (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete#maps_places_autocomplete-html), so that firebaseConfig and Google Signup are based on .env which may then be included in .gitignore (https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/hiding-secret-keys-in-create-react-app). The font difference between class names mainpageExpertSignup and mainpageSubHeaderSignup is that the latter has a -webkit-text-stroke: 1px block; which has been commented out.

    For ./pages/index.js, puts 1em (current font size) of space between Why Us? by editing .mainpageWhyQooleyHeader and .mainpageWhyQooleyFlexbox :) the .mainpageExpertSpotlightMain height has been set to auto for all screen sizes at once instead of being variably defined for screens depending on which side of 800px width. Mobile View: sets exploreOurExpertsMobileScreen line-height to match the Boost Engagement div and this means 1.5em line-height. Creating a separate CSS class for mobile divs is unnecessary, given that the scope of @media is clearly indented. For 799px or lower screen size, changes line-height to 1em on .exploreOurExperts. To keep up with the .mainpageWhyQooleyHeader having 1em on top and bottom, sets the height on it to 200px, which allows the .mainpageWhyQooley to adaptively adjust to the height block. On the Admin Dashboard, Index Page, Local, Qooleybiz Corporate, Qooleybiz Index, Signup, and Venues, to solve the TypeError: Class constructor SweetAlert cannot be invoked without 'new', imports SweetAlert2 from 'sweetalert2'; and rather than assigning const swal = new SweetAlert2(); for the sake of consistency with the existing code, calls upon new SweetAlert2(). Except on pages/venues.js with the SweetAlert2.fire({}) constructor form. Removes unused imports on ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js and on adminDashboard along with the assignment of function calls, on /qooleybiz/index.js and on /venues.js. Removes commented-out code and API calls, on qooleybiz and on adminDashboard.

    * On the Home React Component, adds class exploreOurExpertsMobileScreen which aligns the text to the left with a margin of 1em. Instead of the light blue style being in-line, innately defines the color lightblue in the .exploreOurExperts class. Generates the boostEngagement class which takes on the font-size, family, and weight, as well as the color, position and text-alignment (these are 30px, Open Sans, sans-serif and 500, white, relative, and center respectively) of the original in-line styles. The boostEngagementMobileView class gains overflow-wrap, and similarly instead of setting in-line gridTemplateColumns, adds servicesAndPackagesFullDiv and servicesAndPackagesMobileVersion and fixes the width and height of an image in the .serviceDivImg class.
    * servicesAndPackages and href #exploreOurExperts have been reused to host images on the Boost engagement and retention at your company! To free up in-line space on pages/index.js, the serviceDivTitle class holds all accompanied div properties like transform, height, and font.
    * For the sake of ameliorating redundancies, on the onboarding, team building, engagement, and perks & rewards sections moves the color property further up the div hierarchy.
    * Corrects class to className and on globals.css, corrects border to solid on hover for .servicesAndPackages.
    * The grid-template-columns CSS property repeats 3 elements per row, with (https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/) fraction of the remaining free space.
    * When visitors hover over the “What We Specialize In” text, displays swal alert with position top-start, button false, and a timer with icon false such that the text displays for 1500 milliseconds. Instead of in-line swal, includes helper function swalWhatWeSpecializeIn.
    * Full-justifies the text under Planning a Custom Event?, and because most browsers don’t support the text-justify: inter-character property, includes width: 17.5vw on .mainpageTestimonial such that the testimonials are easier to read and changes font size to 1em;. Justifies the mainpageWantToHostText and the mainpageUniqueCultureText, mainpageHealthWellbeingText, & mainpageOnboardingText, and the About Us page with text-justify: inter-character.

    * Models ./pages/venue.js after the order of elements in the ./pages/venues.js venue signup form, and Venue External Links Display: extracts externalLinks from this.state.venueData, so we can include that missing field and provide continuity and consistency between the signup page and the display page, while checking for the existence of each variable before displaying it via the && operator’s potential for short-circuit evaluation.
    * Includes linkedinURL in submission from ./pages/venues.js. Renames Admission Price field on ./pages/venue.js and orders the elements according to the order on ./pages/venues.js. Splits the externalLinks string by the ‘,’ character and maps to line-separated divs.
    * On ./pages/index.js, changes exploreOurExperts id to exploreOurServices, so that the button redirects to the next page as before. On the ‘Boost engagement and retention at your company!’ section, places all divs as Nav.Link divs introducing the servicesAndPackages class for its on-hover effects, in addition to invoking the ReactGA handleButtonClick function and the href #exploreOurExperts which links to the next page (Explore Our Experts) after the Services and Packages page.
    * On the ‘What We Specialize In’ section, includes https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_slide.asp with proper text justification which allows us to overlay text on a relatively positioned container, relative to the nearest parent flexbox item contrasted with an absolutely positioned overlay, with overflow hidden (so that text doesn’t appear to the left of the image when it’s not being hovered on) and alignment to the bottom, left, and right. The text wraps neatly with 90% of the overlay width, and as a special effect each overlay attains a width of 100% when the container for the overlay is hovered upon.

        * Puts a line break between image and description on ./pages/venue
        * Removes background image and sets color of text on ./pages/venues to #5f0455, and changes h3 from Venue to Add Venue.
        * Comments out background of .venues class
        * On ./pages/venues, expands the textarea on 'Amenities & Accessibility' as well as on 'What makes us unique?', to height: "9em”, and makes them optional. Capitalizes Optional.
            * Moves Notes to underneath the Description and changes the name to What to bring and how to prepare - adds How to Prepare / What to Bring to the title, and sets the height to 9em.
            * Adds spacing between the text fields (on ./pages/venues).
            * To fix the issue of no picture render unless the carousel is clicked, rather than dispatching non-existent element functions like onClick, includes $('.BrainhubCarousel__arrowRight').trigger('click') within the componentDidMount interval; uses jQuery to simulate clicking on the right arrow.
        * In ./pages.activity.js to fix long load times only on localhost:3000 and the test server, puts componentDidMount into the asynchronous setInterval function which, in this case, runs the original componentDidMount code once the email is fetched from this.props.router.query.email.
        * Moves Venue.js title to before the cover image, both of which are rendered after the Navbar and before the venuesInformation div, matching the white color of the Navbar text. Also displays Venue.js title after the cover image, with the #5f0455 color. The cover image takes up the whole page like the /local profile. Removes background color.
        * Adds style={{ textAlign: 'justify', textJustify: 'inter-word' }} to paragraphs Description, Amenities & Accessibility, Notes, and What Makes Us Unique, which justifies them fully.
        * For venue.js, creates .venuePageTitle class which shares all style properties with .activityPageTitle.
        * On ./pages/index.js, removes the handleSelect function because it’s redundant, and binds the citySelect function to this.
        * Adds border radius 0.25rem to the TagsSubmission class .react-tagsinput to match the fields on venues.js.
        * Drop-down for price on /venues same as for the artists and experts signup; creates venuesDropdownMenu identifier for the .dropdown-menu and .dropdown-menu .show classes which set the background-color to transparent, border to none, height to auto, and width to 100%, all of which contribute to the menu’s design. Importing handleButtonClick which is for Google Analytics, DropdownButton and Dropdown from ‘react-bootstrap’ and initializing the nested objects in the allPriceRanges array which is on this.state, this binds priceSelect which defines the priceRange on this.state and it is the priceSelect function along with handleButtonClick which is implicated in the DropdownButton and Dropdown.Item divs of the drop-down menu. The dropdown items have the price.label as the eventKey.
            * On the drop-down sets the venuesDropdownItem:hover to be rgb(38 143 255 / 50%);, which is the same color as the .btn:focus box shadow color of the DropdownButton, for which the #venuesDropdownPriceRange id matches the background color of the form fields rgb(232, 240, 254); and for which the font size is 0.75em and the text is aligned to the left.
            * On the form, submits this.state.priceRange instead of the form controlId priceRangePreference.
        * On the /venue Profile page moves Notes to underneath the Description, same order as the /venues creation page.
        * For CSS classes .currencyInput, #venuesDropdownPriceRange, #venuesDropdownItem, associated side effects of the background color change from white to transparent are none.
        * Replaces helloThere with reactMultiCarouselCard.
        * On ./pages/index.js, changes “Explore our Experts below” to “Explore our Services and Packages below”.
        * On ./pages/index.js, removes the Contact Us part with social media links and removes the Logos and Testimonials because we have those below.
        * On ./pages/venues.js, removes as=“button” from the DropdownButton so that instead of triggering form submit on price range select, we can set the title property of the DropdownButton div to be a ternary displaying this.state.priceRange or alternatively “How does your price work?”. And makes sure externalLinks and instagramURL, twitterURL, facebookURL, are drawn from this.state instead of being drawn from the e.target.elements from on the submitForm function, so that on ./pages/venue.js they can be retrieved and rendered.

    On ./pages/index.js puts 'Venues' category on the initial this.state. Remove console logs. On ./pages/index.js, fetching all database venues filtering by this.state.city, pushes venue link with card along the line of the expert cards. With regex, places venue name with spaces replaced by hyphens on the venue card URL. In ./pages/venues.js, creates uploadPhotos function based on const storageRef = firebase.storage().ref() which is the basis object. Referring to the Firebase storage collection document venues and the storageRef object's child, updatePhotos has storageRef `venues/photos/${officialName}/${file.name}`. Creates changeCoverImg along the line of uploadPhotos, making one change from venues/photos/${officialName}/${file.name} to venues/coverImg/${officialName}/${file.name}. In ./pages/venues.js where changeCoverImg originally did not make use of the officialName appellation, currently providing the officialName parameter and preparing the uploadItems object for de-structuring by turning it into array form, the effect being to enable Venues' submission of cover images. Makes the venue structure such that each venue name has a coverImg folder and its constituent photos. At the Firebase Storage Ref for venues/venueName, fetches all res and by extension res items properties, for which each item has an imageRef parameter. Initializes venue images empty array on this.state so that the array can be updated based on the current value on this.state similarly to a reducer. With method chaining, updates the venue images and venue cover images (after making the awaited database query) with the help of the venuesHelperFunction on ./pages/index.js which allows us to access this.state within the .listAll() async await Firebase API function. Once the venue images are on this.state they can render within the Card.Img src. Instead of pulling venue images and cover images off of this.state, actually sends them first to the venuesHelperFunction. Instead of fetching venues on refresh() within the existing responseAllVenues, since we're awaiting Firebase Storage requests we do it within a separate async fetchVenues() function which then calls the venuesHelperFunction. With dot notation, refers to the variable namd and that's why we use bracket notation; to specify reference to a variable. Moves await this.fetchVenues() to the beginning of async componentDidMount in order to make venue data freely available to the refresh() function. When refreshing, fetches venue cover image from this.state, and renders as the card image with a default image as well. Creates ./pages/venue.js after ./pages/activity.js, initializing super() in the constructor, setting the Navbar on this.state, and initializing ReactGA in the try/catch block in componentDidMount. On .pages/venue.js, the staging page for the venues, adds firebaseConfig, initializes the app, and creates the Venue class component such that venue fetching is governed by the getVenue function, which is bound to this and which includes the setTimeout function to recursively call itself until reaching the venueId which arrives on this.props.router.query. After fetching the venueId, replaces dashes with spaces and, assuming there is no hashtag, successfully accesses the Firebase Storage Bucket at venues/${router}, loading the imageRef and its type (the last three characters) so that we can populate the showcase object with its basis on this.state and with ReactPlayer or img, depending on whether or not the type is .mov. After this, accesses the subfolder venues/${router}/coverImg and then sets these URLS & the showcase on this.state. Shout out to some really cool CSS designs at https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds which inspired my isometric cubes background! On componentDidMount, ensures that both the showcase and cover image are being fetched by re-rendering the component by this.setState({}), at an interval of 100 milliseconds. Then initializes ReactGA, fetches all venue data, and filters the one matching this.state.router which is our venue ID. On the render() section, de-structures the venue data and modeled after the ./pages/activity.js page, renders the venue page in no particular order with the expert carousel mobile version and the classical screen version both included on the front-end.

    Removes "Other" category, adds $ on Admission Price on ./venues. On ./pages/index.js, while reusing the classes exploreOurExpertsDiv and class & id exploreOurExperts, right after the first main page section adds Explore our Services and Packages <Row>. In in-line CSS on the Explore our Services and Packages main row, fits out display grid for upcoming categories Artists & Entertainers, Immersive Experiences, Speakers & Coaches, Venues, Company Swag, and Event Services with display grid with 3 columns justified to the center with width and margin auto and equal, 20px grid column gap and grid row gap such that we are able to overlay text over the images with the help of linear transformations (translate). After that, creates What We Specialize in section with ONBOARDING, TEAM BUILDING, ENGAGEMENT, and PERKS & REWARDS titles and images with flex-box horizontal. Includes Clients & Testimonials with custom flex-box and within it gridTemplateColumns for 4 columns and 4 rows, incrementing from the left side of the grid by over-riding the left value in pixels via in-line styles while still using the .thinkChicago, .universityChicagoMedicalCenter, ..., redShelf CSS classes. This time, unlike the Our Customers section we're not including the white background and are instead overlaying directly on the purple background of #5f0455 currently keeping the width and height of each customer at 100px. At the bottom of ./pages/index.js's Explore our Services and Packages row div, after the properly formatted testimonial with margin-left 10vw, font-weight of 550 which rounds down to 500 at lower values, and text align to the left, creates Contact Us section with Flaticon vector icons. Adds opacity of 50% for the icons flexbox.

    On ./pages/activity.js phone version - text is shrunk down with the same ratio between header and text - smaller font so it’s easier to navigate.  Using Chef Alex as the model, we’ve got on /activity the decreased Private Dinners with Food and Drinks title and subtitle text shrunk down with same 65/30 ratio between title and subtitle.  The image fits with 1em space and now, the font-size for h3 is 1.75rem which is greater than 1.25rem for h5, giving a ratio of 1.4 so the activity expert name, which has padding-top: 0; for mobile screens max width 600px refactoring styles into classes for example the .activityText class, will have a font-size of 1.4em while the activity expert category will have a font size of 1em!  The activityMainPageSecondPart class specifically is designed to present a margin of 1em; this will, along with the activityPageTitle class having a width of 100% instead of 100vw, allow the page to have truly centered, minified title and text with a margin border.  For smaller screens (<= 600px) on signup and login, sets width to be 100%, left and right to be 0. :) On ./pages/about.js, optimizes mobile view for header and text boxes.  On ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.js, for the mobile view allows the text to fill the screen with the qooleyBizCorporateAllEncompassingPage set to margin: 1em 1em 0 1em; which is to say that the margin on the bottom is equal to 0, and refactors in-line styles to globals.css.  With flex-direction column, hides the calendar react-date picker class react-datepicker__month-container and then justifies content to the left.  For the mobile view on ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js when edit ? Is true, refactors in-line paragraph styles into classes and gives them a margin of 1em and maintaining the 65 to 35 ratio between profile name and profile category, shrinks them to the mobile size of 1.85em to 1em and then fleshes out the splashPhoto and splashPhotoOverlay classes, as well as the profilePic, profilePicOverlay, which are adapted from the in-line styles on ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js.  Transfers in-line styles for the main venues div on ./pages/venues.js to globals.css #venuesMain, with which we can set margin to 1em and width to auto for mobile devices, and updates pricing placeholder to include per hour in the prompt.  In ./components/mynavbar.js, adds new section for NavBar such that the venues page has removed the links to “Become a Qooley Expert” or “Already an Expert?” only when on the venues page leaving the “About Us” page there.

    Yes the react-https-redirect library is working very well, once you connect to ./pages/index.js.  On ./pages/index.js, from top 1em, pushes the virtual down closer to the title so there’s not as much of a space; cuts the space in half.  On ./pages/venues.js, Price Range Preference Select menu is now a Form.Control as textarea, with placeholder ‘How does your price work?  What pricing works with number of attendees?’, Select menu from ‘City of residence’ to ‘City’, space (line break) <br /> before and after the Venue <h3 /> title.  Based on the ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js signup page or alternatively the ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.js - the add a new experience page - adds ‘Upload Images and Videos for the Venue’ paragraph HTML tag <p> with ImageGallery component with the property ‘addMediaItem={this.addMediaItem}’, for which the function addMediaItem, derived from ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js (or alternatively ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.js), is bound to `this` component and takes the blob and file and sets them on this.state.mediaUpload, which is initialized to the empty array type, as well as for which the ImageGallery component itself is imported, from our perspective, from `./qooleybiz/imageGallery.js`.  On ./pages/venues.js, adds a <br /> space after the Form to create some space.  Installs sweetalert2 from sweetalert2.github.io in order to import Swal from ‘sweetalert2’ and then Swal.fire the confirm save message with a creative thumbs up icon and then if saved, the message "Thank you for submitting your venue's information.  We will review the information you have provided, and your venue will be listed on our website, upon approval.  Please contact admin@qooley.com for any questions.”.  Removes Form.Control text field for ‘Pictures’, and instead puts a LinkedIn Form.Control with corresponding LinkedIn name, label, placeholder, and onChange functions…, encapsulating the social media links within a Form.Group so that we can have a controlId=“formBasicSocialMediaLinks”, the data from which can be sent to the database, taking formBasicPictures out of the submission and adds formBasicExternalLinks to the External Links Form.Group (for now we are getting this.state.externalLinks on the form which is what the TagsSubmission component does), removing formBasicAgreeToTermsAndConditions and formBasicCoverImage as well as formBasicCity in favor of this.state.city which makes city selection dynamic, making the block conditional on whether if (this.state.checkboxChecked) is true (else, a Swal alert notifies that ‘Agree to Terms & Conditions needs to be checked.’).  The API request currently deconstructs the form, with accompanying async keyword both on the submitForm function and on the .then statement proposed by Swal.  Within this block, which is conditional on whether this.state.checkboxChecked is true, awaits this.uploadPhotos whenever this.state.mediaUpload.length > 0, along the same line for the existence of this.state.coverImg - awaits this.changeCoverImg.  These two functions, both this.setCoverImg and this.changeCoverImg being this-bound to the component, are currently empty placeholders.  Currently, the submitForm function submits data to the database except photos, for which it is self-contained in that it does not make an API request to send the cover image and venue photos & videos to Firebase.

    Makes venues class encompassing the only place where the color change attribute rgb(232, 240, 254) is applied.  Currently, phone number, birthday, brief bio, why should you be booked… are actually required; the browser scrolls up to show the missing fields.  If the profile picture is not uploaded and the category is not selected, then the browser displays a pop-up message saying, Please ensure all required fields are completed.  Npm installs react-https-redirect and wraps the ./index.js component with HttpsRedirect such that the component should redirect us to https. Adds ‘specify how many attendees’ text to ./pages/customBookings.js.  On the ./qooleybiz page from the signup side, introduces the isComplete variable, form.bio.value.length > 0 && form.birthday.value.length > 0 && form.category.value.length > 0 && !!this.state.city && form.funfacts.value.length > 0 && form.phone.value.length > 0 && form.whybook.value.length > 0 && !!this.state.priceRange, which prompts the else statement, within which the alert message ‘Please ensure all required fields are completed’ pops up.  Furthermore, the category drop-down menu is put on this.state which allows category to have field validation text to indicate that it is required, only when it does not exist or when it is equal to ‘Select category’.  Price Range, Fun Facts, Category, City of Residence, are now required indicated with the asterisk * and Social Media Link titles (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) are now invisible unless there’s nothing there.

    On ./pages/venues.js, makes Price Range Preference have a width of 100%.  On ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate and ./pages/activity.js, with moment(_).format('MM DD YYYY'), makes sure the experience preview on ./qooleybiz/corporate looks *nearly* exactly like the /activity page, for which the price is month-day-year, and for which the expert *cover* image, name, category, showcase, experience name, category, description, start & end date, duration, notes, activity location and max attendees, and price are available, where meeting location is "Virtual" or "Live", and if "Live" then street city state and zipcode are named.  Changes Admission Price to Your Price on qooleybiz/corporate, and includes on form display price y=[x+0.3]/.771, x is the expert price.  On ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.js, the time display 3 hours and 30 minutes shortens to _3.5 hrs_, rounding to two digits after the decimal place, string parses right before submission; and by the way changes already existing database entries to this shortened format.  On ./pages/index.js, reduces the font size slightly; does duration and title.  Price aligns left-bottom of experience card.  Yes, immersive experiences are rendering!  On ./pages/venues.js, changes header to "Venue" instead of "Venues", changes "Name" header and placeholder to "Venue Name", and for the social media links, gives options for IG, FB, Twitter, and LinkedIn, just like the other profiles with valid URL check and matching background color for all venue fields.  Since we don't need city of residence for Venue; a venue does not reside somewhere, for the location field breaks it into "Street Address" and "City" dropdown so it can still show up under the city from the sort feature on our front page.  Adds some space between the "Venue" header and the first field at the top of the page.

    On the time display, shortens 3 hours and 30 minutes to 3.5 hrs by, on ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.js, rounding to two digits after the decimal place with a string which parses right before the submission!  Changes existing entries in the database to match abbreviated duration format, reduces the font size of each immersive experience title and duration on ./pages/index.js slightly.  Price aligns on the left-bottom of the expereince card, and the database table for venues is created.

    Creates a new category called “Venue” with the categories Name, Phone Number, Location (Address), Description, Amenities & Accessibility, What makes us unique?, Capacity (Attendance), Social Media Links, Pictures, External Links, Price Range, Agree to T & C button.  Creates the ./pages/venues.js page: Does `touch venues.js` in pages/venues.js, which contains a form with form elements having the backgroundColor rgb(232, 240, 254), which is a computed style from the email type and password Form.Control type, pulling off Form.Group controlIds from e.target.elements and then finding their .value.  On the form, there’s custom height, 11em, and rows='3' set on the Form.Control div.  With Agree to Terms & Conditions checkbox from ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js and accompanying checkboxChecked: false initial value on this.state with this binding for the new handleCheckboxChange function which sets e.target.checked on this.state.  Cover Image is imported from ../components/coverImg.js with accompanying setCoverImg function which is referenced early on in the this.state declaration, which includes the coverImg and splashPhoto initial keys. Models Price Range Preference along the lines of ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js, for which Select is imported from ‘react-select’ and priceRange: null, is initialized on this.state.  From ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js adds custom text for Location (Address), Amenities & Accessibility, What makes us unique?, Capacity (Attendance), Notes, and the City Form element has accompanying Axios filters GET on componentDidMount with TagsSubmission component for getting externalLinks on this.state.  API_URL http://localhost port is 4000 instead of 5000 to solve EADDRINUSE: address already in use.

Pushes to the Immersive Experiences image carousel only if approvedProfileEmails.includes(immersiveActivities[i].email), on ./pages/index.js.  Flags the experiences that are virtual with a "Virtual" sticker - purple background - color #5f0455 - top right corner of the experience card - like the sticker on the first page; sharing style from the virtual label on the ./pages/index.js top page between the virtual label and the experiences' 'virtual' flag, styles the "Virtual" sticker in the top right of the immersive experience card when immersiveActivites[i].immersiveActivity is virtual.

Adds toggle slider for in-line preview & calendar.  On Form.Control & DatePicker, converts onChange to a proper function.  Moves styles from preview div on ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.js to ./styles/globals.css.  Sets Form.Control value={this.state.endDate ? this.state.endDate : moment(this.state.endDateFull).format().slice(0,10)}.  Maintains continuity of data types (Date() and 2021-10-28) between this.state.startDate & this.state.startDateFull.  On the 'Show Preview' text slider, decreases size and boldens weight.

    Makes it mandatory to add at least one image to the experiences on the experiences page, includes new design for scheduling with in-line calendar, and experience preview.  Since when you upload to Firebase Storage Bucket, which creates a resized image, that is as soon as the image is uploaded Firebase generates a thumbnail, we're able to display compressed images as needed; the cards can fetch the compressed images and on the profile fetch the high-resolution one.  On the frontend, renders experiences which are current even if they don't have a start date or an end date.  On the activity page if there is no address and they select in-person, then says "Address to be determined" without repeating.  Adds a field to experiences: max number of attendees allowed.  :)

    On pages/corporate.js, replaces placeholder with value = {this.state.nameThisActivity && this.state.nameThisActivity} and onChange={e => this.setState({ startDate: e.target.value })} so that existing text isn't greyed out but is displayed and is editable.  On /activity.js and ./pages/index.js, type.toLowerCase === 'mov' allows us to recognize MOV and mov file types and remove them from the immersive experience image cards because they render as empty rectangles.  In corporate.js, sets database immersiveActivity[0].dateStart on this.state.startDate, and destructures and sets all key values from immersiveActivity[0].dateStart, for which this.state has initial values startDate: new Date() and endDate: new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() + 1).  The image thumbnails, for which the image compression is 800 x 800, are determined through the Firebase URL.  Installs webshim, jQuery, and React-DatePicker.

    On the main page ./index, the title of the experience card expands up, not down; on the .helloThere div which is the container div for the main page cards, changes justify-content from center to flex-end, and height from nothing to 40vh; there's a subtle difference between height auto and height 40vh.  The height is the same for all cards, including the Comedy cards!  There's a 100 character limit on the title for submitting an immersive experience on ./pages/qooleybiz/corporate.

    Experts can create paragraphs by typing line breaks, which are used to split the immersive activity description on /pages/activity.js.  On qooleybiz/corporate all fields are required because the document title is used to identify the Firebase experiences collection document, along with the expert email.  On pages/activity.js, the experience name from the database and the experience name from the URL are trimmed of whitespace before making the check for equality :).

    Between ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js and ./pages/local.js, on ./pages/local.js, containerClass={‘react-multi-carousel-list’} instead of containerClass={‘react-multi-carousel-list react-multi-carousel-list-immersive’}, which along with right: ‘0’, width: ‘100vw’, makes the immersive experience carousel on the View Profile page not fit along the left side of the page, but fit near the center of the page; this is the ideal position.  Moves title to the top of the immersive experience card so that it can and does take up the full space of the title.  On ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js specifically on the Edit Profile page, changes activity title from the letter x to ×, which is the multiplication symbol.  On ./pages/index.js, where immersiveActivitiesExist, sets immersive activity on carousel only if moment().isAfter(dayStart) and moment().isBefore(dayEnd) so that if the expert wants to host Experience ABC from October 15th-November 15th, it should only show up on the website under Immersive Experiences between those dates.  Only displays the cards that are within the start date and the end date.  Fetches current date; if the current date is greater than the start date and less than the end date, then displays it.  Any of the artists and experts can create Immersive Experiences… if they are already approved, they can create experiences without any approvals.  Displays swal alert if immersive experience is requested to be deleted via async deleteExperience(experienceEmailAndName).  Are you sure you want to delete after clicking button.  Aligns cards the same way on both View and Edit profile pages!  Removes validEmails array being used as a criterion for pushing to the immersive experiences carousel in pages/index.js; validEmails is created based on Object.keys(allUsers), which contains the categories identifying each user, for which allUsers is the array of all users grouped by category being displayed on the website.  That is, allUsers[category][I].email is the email for the expert at that category name :D.

On /qooleybiz?true sets a href to target = "_blank" to open new tab, including e.preventDefault() to prevent redirecting to /local?userId=' + this.state.profileData.username.  On qooleybiz/corporate, changes *value* to placeholder to prepopulate form fields, and on qooleybiz/corporate wraps uploadPhotos in try/catch block to log errors to the console.  To prevent file.type is undefined error, checks for the existence of file.  From pages/local.js, removes handleButtonClick function from experience card onClick because it is unused; a href sends the logged-in expert to `/activity/?email=${immersiveActivities[i].email}&experience=${immersiveActivities[i].immersiveActivity.nameThisActivity}`.

    On the main page, adds some space between the price filter and Comedy, or Immersive Experiences; puts a break underneath the price filter regardless of what the category is :).  Clarifies the use of additional pictures on Signup: Upload Pictures and Images of Yourself.  Makes it an optional field.  When submitting an experience, displays a pop-up message which says, "Thank you for creating your experience!  Once your profile is approved, your experience will be visible on the website.  For any questions, please contact us at admin@qooley.com" after you hit submit.  If it's immersive experiences, then only the experience shows up and not the expert.  Conditionally focuses on address fields based on the truth value of this.state.requestAddress.  Adds required={false} so that the error, An invalid form control with name='zipcode' is not focusable., is fixed.  Styles seal background-color to #5f04542d;.  Adds swal alert message with accompanying .then((willSubmit) =>  { … function which conditionally continues the immersive experience submission code and sends the expert to Router.push('/login?redirect=/qooleybiz’).  Only pushes expert card with profile picture if if (category !== 'Immersive Experiences') { is true, that is, if the category is not Immersive Experiences.  The plus button has a greater margin on the pages/local.js page to follow along with the Edit View which is /qooleybiz?true.

    With regard to last time's changes which are to put some space between the cards, to be able to see the whole title, make the font slightly smaller so it fits in two lines; should automatically go to the next line if it doesn't fit in one line!  The plus button always goes after the last experience.  Makes Immersive Experiences on the View Profile page title larger and gives it space.  On qooleybiz?true, the edit profile.  When you click a card, the same qooleybiz/corporate page shows up with the information filled in for editing because people are going to make typos!  We display the name of the experience for the immersive experience.  Enables localhost:3000/local?userId=deangladish26 to render by using the immersiveExperienceImageUrls variable itself instead of this.state.immersiveExperienceImageUrls, because it takes a while to set variable values on this.state.  Changes the url slug because the URL slug is putting an = sign in front of each query key, because these are key:value pairs; this.props.router.query is an object.  Adds line breaks <br /> between the Immersive Experiences header before and after, and changes the font size from the h3 to the h2 HTML tag.  Imports { withRouter } from "next/router" and exports default withRouter(Activity), changing routes for example to localhost:3000/activity?email=aaaaaabc%40email.com&experience=the%20second.  this.props.router.query takes time to load so instead of putting it at the beginning of (async) componentDidMount, it can be put at the end of componentDidMount.  So the route is this.props.router.query with the object { email, experience, edit } and for which we can destructure email, experience, and edit: let { email, experience, edit } = this.props.router.query, for which const setShowcaseItems = this.setShowcaseItems.  Fetches images at email for Firebase immersiveExperienceShowcase Storage Bucket and experience data *filtered* from /experiences/search/all.  The required format for Form.Control *value* property is "yyyy-MM-dd".  Sets the date and adds initial value property in the JSX on Form.Control.  Sets the duration, transfers it from immersiveActivity[0] fetched from /experiences/search/all to this.state.immersiveActivityDuration from within componentDidMount.  {} && within JSX allows us to do shortcircuit evaluation to execute the code even if the this.state.immersiveActivity[0] prerequisite for .category doesn't yet exist!  Runs this.deletePhotos; button onClick = { e => console.log requires e => to be stated, parameters are based on this.props.router.query email and before that, *edit === 'true'*.  Renders the button conditionally on edit === 'true'.  Styles Delete Photos button based on Submit button Inspect Element.  On qooleybiz/corporate edit mode, prepopulates Form elements sent from e.target.element, the react-bootstrap library.  Cleans up console logs.

    Adds space between the cards as a margin.  Removes unused code related to the Immersive Experiences carousel and the Form.Control version of External Links, for which we have TagsSubmission component which sets the externalLinks value on pages/qooleybiz/index.js’s this.state from within TagsSubmission.  Immersive Experiences carousel cards have the greatest width needed to accommodate the image width, and to the right of the Immersive Experiences image carousel there is the plus button which redirects to the /qooleybiz/corporate page.  Customizes the title H3 on each card so that the card titles are small enough to be longer and still fit within 2 lines; on all divs by default overflow is visible.  Removes commented-out carousel for this.state.immersiveExperienceItems.  On pages/local.js, removes existing carousel for this.state.immersiveExperienceItems.  Adds React Multi Carousel with Immersive Experiences Cards to the View Profile page, called ReviewCarousel.  Adds &${immersiveActivities[i].immersiveActivity.nameThisActivity} to the a href on the cards for pages/index.js, pages/local.js, and pages/qooleybiz/index.js.  Fetches the activity information based on the second query object given after & in the URL slug, based on the Router.query arguments.  On pages/qooleybiz/index.js, redirects us to /qooleybiz/corporate/immersive activity email=&immersive activity name=&edit.  qooleybiz/corporate has the logged-in  /user/getProfileData immersive activities collection for the logged-in expert.

    Provided that First Name and Last Name are separated on /signup, separates First Name and Last Name on /qooleybiz.  Centers the display on the experience page, and on the Edit Profile page shows the existing experience card; everything that you add will start filling the Edit Profile page from left to right.  That is if there are experiences linked to this profile, fetches those experiences as cards along the line of the main page cards.  The same card from the main page shows up on the expert logged-in Edit Profile.  On pages/qooleybiz/index.js, which is the signup page, last time we removed displayName.  Adds it back - displayName is not redundant because displayName is different from First Name and Last Name.  Adds back Upload Images and Videos because these are for the artist/expert who can create multiple immersive experiences each of which also carries its own Upload Images and Videos feature specific to each experience, on the next page /qooleybiz/corporate.  Changes displayName from textarea to input, and refactors the data value from displayName to displayFirstName and displayLastName, with regard to which the /user/updateProfile API route and Firebase does not have any restrictions on the names of the data fields which are submitted by the new format of the Signup Page with name='displayFirstName' and 'displayLastName'.  Adds Immersive Experience Image Carousel to the Edit Profile Page.  Changes background color and border of .react-carousel-item to 'none', and only renders immersive experiences for the current expert.

On pages/local.js, includes a button which links the logged-in expert to the /qooleybiz/corporate page which is our Immersive Experience signup page.  On /qooleybiz/corporate, completes styling including removing the black text color such that the color is consistent with the Qooley text color #5f0455, decreases size of headers by turning them into divs, adding line breaks and changing form controls for Name This Activity, Activity Category, Fill Out Information, and Activity Notes to add text for describing more information about your activity, and any special notes, providing space between lines and height for the textarea fillOutInformation and the textarea activityNotes.  Also removes Immersive Experience images and videos, while adding our eight selected category options in the form of a drop-down menu: these are Food and Drinks, Health & Wellness, Arts & Entertainment, History & Culture, Outdoor Adventures, Educational, Professional Training, and Volunteer Experiences.  On the Immersive Experience page Meeting Location form, puts State and Zipcode side by side, removes input reset Clear Form button, adds & symbol to category options and response.data.data.category retrieval of those options.  On ./pages/qooleybiz/index.js, makes sure to remove First Name and Last Name from the Signup page because they appear on the original /signup page, keeping phone number on the page and including the asterisks while removing the accompanying 'required field' text.  Upload Images and Videos for Expert Signup has also been removed for the sake of redundancy given that the option to Upload Images and Videos appears on the Immersive Activity Creation Page, and font has been aligned with the Qooley default fonts.

    moves the immersive experience editing feature to the Edit Profile page!  Through async componentDidMount() {..., fetches data from process.env.API_URL + '/experiences/search/all' with credentials true which fetches the `experiences` collection documents from Firebase, and based on the `experiences` collection documents' emails fetches the image URLs from the Firebase Storage bucket which is how we render the immersive experience image gallery/carousel on the Edit Profile page.

    On activity page, removes default profile picture because the default profile picture shows up during the data load which doesn’t fit every experience situation; instead of showing a default image while the database loads, we are going to require the artist who signs up for the Immersive Experiences category to have a profile picture; the artist should have a profile picture when they sign up for an account to put a face to the experience.

    removes some console logs for clarity; to keep runtime data flow in order, puts showcase construction and state setting within the await firebase.storage().ref... call.  Makes the imageRef getDownloadURL async/await to allow setShowcaseItems calls to be asynchronous.  Instead of being rendered when the arrow buttons are clicked for the first time, the value of this.state.showcase is allowed to be completely populated at the time of the rendering.  That is allows the promise to resolve if the data has not been yet fetched.  Whether or not the immersive experience image gallery is fetched asynchronously, the immersive experience image gallery gets updated continuously; without a promise, render() happens sooner than this.state.showcase is populated.  On /qooleybiz/corporate, removes background color and navbar color to match Edit Profile Page :).  Removes cover image and adjusts height.  Since the immersive experience image card for email12308902@email.com on localhost:3000 is not rendering the sample image of the immersive experiences being displayed, it's important within update() about creating HTML as in <Card.Img src={immersiveExperienceFirstUrl ? immersiveExperienceFirstUrl : 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-15.....'}, it's important that the data immersiveExperienceFirstUrl should be available when render calls for it.  This is one of the traits of async functions-their return values are guaranteed to be converted to promises!  An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the await keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.  Converts brainhubeu/react-carousel into a carousel with slidesPerPage measured as the number of images in this.state.immersiveExperienceItems, as a carousel without arrows which is neither centered, nor infinite, and not draggable.

    Adds a plus button to the experience feature for generating a multi-faceted image carousel experience with a button that is present so that we can add new experiences.  Makes the expert experience image carousel thinner; it has no reason to be taking up the whole width of the page.  What can cause data to be loaded in a different order in React... elements on this.state not being there some of the time such as this.state.immersiveExperienceImageUrls?  Resizes carousel, styles plus button based on Qooley colors, links the button via new tab to /qooleybiz/corporate, and adjusts the height of the image to be shorter.  On pages/local.js, verifies the existence of this.state.reviews before accessing this.state.reviews.length === 0.  If this.state.loggedIn is not true, then the plus button to add more experiences does not display so that only experts can add experiences which fits in with our vision for the website.  Besides, the button directs to the /qooleybiz/corporate page which redirects to the /login page if you aren't signed in so you'd be prompted to sign in to access req.session.user.email which is part of the document title of the new immersive experience document or part of the email key of the existing immersive experience document at that email address.  :)

Displays an arbitrary image, the image on the url list at index 0, on the Immersive Experiences carousel associating emails with URLs.

The addMediaItem function captures the media on this.state and seeks to upload to Firebase Storage.  Provides Firebase Credentials, and includes the email address returned from req.session by the server when updating the Firebase Storage tab at email/immersiveExperiencesShowcase/file.name!  :)

    Based on the wording within the apps, which is really similar, puts the wording "What is the date range within which you want to host?".  Shortens the length of the fields, puts them side-by-side with the captions too: the first one is the start date, and the second one is the end date.  Both fields are on the same line!  Puts "How long is it going to be, when do you want this to be available?".  Once you've selected Activity Duration, it automatically populates that field.  Keep in mind that this screen comes up after they select the category Immersive Experiences; this is just an additional page that's going to go with the rest of the signup process.  Meeting Location address fields are a little more better in design: puts playful, professional but not too professional font and text a half point lower.  Font consistency is established across fields, text is smaller for Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.  TODO: Integrate Google Maps. :)

    On the second signup page: In the second field (how long is the activity going to be?), makes the field a drop-down where you can only select in 15 minute intervals.  Just like in the app, there is a drop-down showing 15 min, 30 min, ... all the way to 8 hours.  The live/in-person distinction is performed through a toggle button just like the QooleyBiz app, and the address field under "Meeting Location" only shows up when you select "In-person".  If the activity is virtual, then the Meeting Location is set on the second signup page's component state to "Virtual".

Adds the approveActivity function which makes an Axios POST request to /activity/approveActivity with directions to the activityDocId and whether to approve or unapprove that activity.

    There's a `See app panel` button which sets the appPanel typeToggle on this.state, this.state.typeToggle is the criterion for conditionally rendering the recursively flattened activities and the app_users Firebase collections.  When flattening objects, remember that autocomplete responds to shift + ( which allows you to continue writing without having to retype the real function name, and that when testing in React use try/catch so that errors can be printed to the console instead of nothing, and the program can continue to run.  If you choose to use This binding in React, write a traditional function instead of an arrow function because otherwise the value of *this* will be the context in which it is declared instead of that context in which it is executed, which will make This binding unnecessary.  Within it when using recursion refer to this.functionName.  Lists are a type of object, key:value pairings for which the keys are 0, 1, 2, ...

In the event that we go to /qooleybiz, the API route handler rejects our request with error code 400 so pages/qooleybiz/index.js redirects us to /logout which queries GET backend.qooley.com/logout which returns 400 (Bad Request) and is not caught as an error by the Logout component, AND we're met with a blank page :) So this commit makes the Learn More button redirect not to /logout but to /signup.

    about me and external links are saving on Edit Profile page and the texts for all fields About Me, Why should you book me?, Fun facts, AND the Gallery Photos are showing up.  When you hit Save without modifying External Links, instead of erasing the External Links they show up now on the View Profile page because we are always putting them on this.state.externalLinks whenever the componentDidMount.

    price range preference is on signup qooleybiz page on a dropdown menu, it's being posted to firebase and returned to the browser from the server successfully.  When a new artist is signing up, there is a checkbox with terms and conditions link (to the pdf).  Added Terms and Conditions hyperlink on the profile creation page AND on the home page as well.  On the home page mobile view, using the same list of unique cities for which we have artists.  Filtering is working now, and all reviews forms submissions are saved to the database and are available on the Admin Dashboard.  On the frontend, did the city sort feature such that the city filter 'includes' the city of each user - city.includes(user.city) - and changed the filter by price and select city drop-down menu background color to the city buttons color.  Local time is being displayed on the email (admin@qooley.com) sent upon requesting an artist for example CST (Central Time), and on the artist page the reviewers' names and date fonts are a little smaller.  So when the review form is filled out, the whole form is on the admin dashboard, and we've gotten the terms and conditions and privacy policy documents uploaded as pdfs which display within the browser.

    only rendering cities for which we have artists.  Can log out of admin dashboard, persistent login for admin dashboard across refreshes using localStorage, arrows fast-forward us to the Explore Artists page using Nav.Link href from React Bootstrap.  Created script for cities that only displays city buttons that have users in them.  Made virtual smaller - specifically the green rectangle, not just the text.  The text is fine.  The main page needs to visually match the Qooley color scheme (#00ffff #5f0455), so I added those colors in to make it more standardized.  The background light blue color on the profile page has been changed to white (that was the #next__ css ID), and also removed black bar at bottom of respondBooking page by making the height fill the page.

    Activity pictures are no longer mandatory!  That means, we can Edit Profile and View Profile, and only render the activity pictures carousel if the artist has uploaded them (if they exist).  The star review and review comments show up on the artist profile, as long as they are approved.  While you still can't browse the website when logged in as an artist (it keeps redirecting to the profile page), this is not an error!  And /sendReviewForm redirects us to the main page now, unless we are an admin.  On the external links section, we are successfully translating the links into http or https, instead of mounting them on localhost:3000.

Date:   Mon Feb 8 19:50:06 2021 -0600

    Decreased blur in images so that you can tell people are having fun (but you don’t know who it is), added drop-down menu on mobile view for city buttons (instead of having each individual button show up),  although the width needs to be increased so that we can see the whole carousel, the cards are wider and there is less space between cards without border, made background a little lighter on the artist page and changed the text to purple, made the design and format of each section on the main page more consistent, made the icons closer together (in a new flex box) on the social media part of the footer, modified the header font on the titles of each section, made hamburger menu only for mobile view and added different versions of it (two more, for edit and view profile), and todo: add all the information for the missing artists and documents for Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy

    Finally figured out how to remove all margins, padding, thinking in terms of flex boxes, and adding a border to react-carousel-item when the user hovers on the .helloThere class which was added by me in order to provide a more inclusive (slightly larger) alternative to the built-in classname react-carousel-item.
